# Stock/Crypto Trading System

This repository contains Python scripts I've built for stock and cryptocurrency trading analysis. 
Each script serves a unique purpose, ranging from data analysis to trade execution, helping to automate and optimize the trading process.

Additionally, a number of dashboards are included to visualize the data and insights generated by the scripts. 
These dashboards provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring market trends, analyzing technical indicators, and making informed trading decisions.
